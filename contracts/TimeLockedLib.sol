 */
contract TimeLockedLib {
    
    /* ========== STEP 1: DEFINE DATA STRUCTURES ========== */
    // Define enums for account and interest types:
    // 1. Create an AccountType enum with options like FIXED_TERM, FLEXIBLE_TERM, LADDER_TERM
    // 2. Create an InterestType enum with options like FIXED, VARIABLE, COMPOUND

    // Define the Account struct:
    // 1. Add fields for account details, such as balances, interest rates, and status flags
    // 2. Arrange fields for gas optimization where possible
    // 3. Include flags for account status, lock duration, and accrued interest

    // Create state mappings for account management:
    // 1. Map user addresses to Account structs: mapping(address => Account)
    // 2. Map addresses to an array of deposit amounts: mapping(address => uint256[])
    // 3. Map addresses to an array of withdrawal amounts: mapping(address => uint256[])
    // 4. Map addresses to cumulative interest earned: mapping(address => uint256)

    /* ========== STEP 3: IMPLEMENT EVENTS ========== */
    // Define required events for contract interaction tracking:
    // 1. Emit AccountCreated event upon account creation
    // 2. Emit DepositReceived event upon each deposit
    // 3. Emit InterestPaid event during interest distribution
    // 4. Emit WithdrawalProcessed event upon each successful withdrawal
    // 5. Emit LockModified event whenever lock periods are updated

    /* ========== STEP 4: CORE FUNCTIONS ========== */
    // Implement account creation logic:
    // 1. Validate user inputs (e.g., minimum deposit amount)
    // 2. Set initial parameters for the account
    // 3. Calculate the interest rate based on account type and duration
    // 4. Set a lock period for the account
    // 5. Emit an AccountCreated event

    // Implement deposit functionality:
    // 1. Verify the account's status before accepting deposits
    // 2. Validate the deposit amount and update the balance
    // 3. Record the deposit in deposit history mapping
    // 4. Emit a DepositReceived event

    // Implement interest calculation method:
    // 1. Calculate the time elapsed since the last interest distribution
    // 2. Apply the appropriate interest calculation formula
    // 3. Handle different interest types (fixed, variable, compound)
    // 4. Update the last calculation time and store the earned interest

    // Implement withdrawal system:
    // 1. Check if the lock period has expired
    // 2. Calculate any applicable penalties for early withdrawal
    // 3. Validate the withdrawal amount
    // 4. Transfer funds to the account owner and update balance
    // 5. Emit a WithdrawalProcessed event

    /* ========== STEP 5: AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS ========== */
    // Implement time lock management:
    // 1. Check the lock status of an account
    // 2. Calculate the remaining lock time
    // 3. Allow for extensions of lock periods
    // 4. Update unlock dates based on new lock period

    // Implement interest rate management:
    // 1. Define a base rate calculation for interest
    // 2. Set multipliers based on the duration of the lock period
    // 3. Adjust rates based on account type
    // 4. Allow for rate updates by the admin

    // Implement penalty system for early withdrawals:
    // 1. Define penalty rates for each type of account
    // 2. Calculate penalty amounts based on the locked duration
    // 3. Address any special cases (e.g., penalty waivers)
    // 4. Deduct penalties before processing the withdrawal

    /* ========== STEP 6: VIEW FUNCTIONS ========== */
    // Implement getter functions for user and admin access:
    // 1. Fetch account details such as balance, lock status, and accrued interest
    // 2. Provide view access to interest earned
    // 3. Check lock status of an account
    // 4. Retrieve transaction history (deposits and withdrawals)
